# network-speed
HTML and javascript network tester. Check the connection between the web server hosting the files and the web client.

I needed a simple way of checking the network speed between the user and my web server.
This network tester uses JQuery and som ajax calls to compute latency and download speed.

This tester is not 100% accurate but gives a quite good estimation.
